Be sure to address the following:
What input do you need from the player? How will you prompt the player for that input? How will you validate the input?
What should the program do if the player enters a valid direction? What output should result?
What should the program do if the player enters an invalid direction? What output should result?
What should the program do if the player enters a valid item (the item in their current room)? What output should result?
What should the program do if the player enters an invalid item (an item not in their current room)? What output should result?
