Create pseudocode or a flowchart that logically outlines the steps that will allow the 
player to get the item from the room they are in and add it to their inventory.

Be sure to address the following:
What input do you need from the player? How will you prompt the player for that input? How will you validate the input?
What should the program do if the player enters a valid item (the item in their current room)? What output should result?
What should the program do if the player enters an invalid item (an item not in their current room)? What output should result?
How will you control the program flow with decision branching or loops?
